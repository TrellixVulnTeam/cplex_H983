<h1 class="title topictitle1">Generic callbacks </h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Generic callbacks are compatible with recent innovations in CPLEX. </p>
<p class="p">First, contrast legacy callbacks, 
such as informational callbacks, query callbacks, or control callbacks 
(already familiar in CPLEX) with the more recent implementation 
of generic callbacks.  Legacy callbacks were designed when CPLEX was a branch-and-bound or 
branch-and-cut solver. Consequently, those legacy callbacks were designed 
to monitor and control a branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut search. This design implies
that those legacy callbacks assume a branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut <strong class="ph b">context</strong> 
throughout their
invocation.  For example,  such legacy callbacks usually assume a
 "current node" context. This assumption is one of the reasons that 
the legacy callbacks are incompatible with dynamic search.</p>
<p class="p">Over time, CPLEX has evolved and now executes more sophisticated strategies than 
straightforward branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut, although that strategy is still at the 
core of the solver. Dynamic search and other features have been added to CPLEX 
to solve models faster.
The generic callback is compatible with all these new features
since it does not assume a strictly branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut perspective in 
the solution process. It only assumes a generic search for an
optimal solution. As a consequence, it does not allow user control of the
the branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut process in as much detail as the
legacy callbacks do. Such low-level control, however, is not usually required.
The degree of control offered by the generic callback is more high level, 
yet frequently that degree of control is all that is needed.</p>
