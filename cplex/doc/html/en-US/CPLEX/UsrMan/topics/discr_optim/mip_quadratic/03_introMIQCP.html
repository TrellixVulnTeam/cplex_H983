<p class="p">As introduced in the topic 
<a class="xref" href="../mip/02_prob_statement.html" title="Defines the kind of problems that the mixed integer optimizer solves.">Stating a MIP problem</a>,
a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem can contain
both integer and continuous variables. If the problem contains an
objective function with no quadratic term, (a <em class="ph i">linear objective)</em>, 
and all the constraints are linear, then the problem
is termed a <em class="ph i">Mixed Integer Linear Program</em> (MILP). </p>
<p class="p">If there is a quadratic term in the objective function and
all the constraints in the model are linear, 
the problem is termed a <em class="ph i">Mixed Integer Quadratic Program</em> (MIQP). 
(For more information about solving a MIQP, see the topic 
<a class="xref" href="02_introMIQP.html" title="Distinguishes types of mixed integer programs according to quadratic terms in the objective function or constraints of the model.">MIQP: mixed integer programs with quadratic terms in the objective function</a>.)
If the model has any <strong class="ph b">constraints</strong> 
containing a quadratic term, regardless of the objective function,
the problem is termed a <em class="ph i">Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Program</em> 
(MIQCP).</p>

MIQCP problems that CPLEX solves.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Conditions on the constraints</p>
<p class="p">Each constraint in the MIQCP model must be an <strong class="ph b">inequality</strong>. Furthermore, each of those 
inequality constraints must satisfy at least one of the following conditions: </p>
