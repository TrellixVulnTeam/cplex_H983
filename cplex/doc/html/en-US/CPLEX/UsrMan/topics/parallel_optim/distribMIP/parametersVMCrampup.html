<h1 class="title topictitle1">VMC file for specifying parameters, ramp up options, and environment variables in distributed parallel optimization</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents how to specify CPLEX parameters, ramp up options, and 
environment variables in a VMC file for distributed parallel optimization.</p>
<p class="p">A virtual machine configuration (VMC) file is an XML file 
that specifies the communication protocol between a master and 
the workers, as well as the configuration of each worker 
(one entry per worker), in a distributed parallel optimization application. 
CPLEX accepts VMC files to specify a virtual machine configuration for 
distributed parallel optimization.</p>
<p class="p">To assist you in creating such a file yourself, 
your installation of the product includes a 
document type definition (DTD) vmc.dtd and 
an XML schema declaration (XSD) vmc.xsd.</p>
<p class="p">Sample VMC files are available in 
<samp class="ph codeph"><em class="ph i">yourCPLEXhome</em>/examples/<em class="ph i">SYSTEM</em>/<em class="ph i">FORMAT</em></samp> 
where </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">yourCPLEXhome</em> specifies the folder or directory 
in your file system where you installed CPLEX as part of 
IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">SYSTEM</em> specifies your combination of computer 
and operating system.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">FORMAT</em> specifies your compiler.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting parameters in a VMC file</h2>
<p class="p">To specify parameter settings in a distributed MIP application, use 
a virtual machine configuration (VMC) file. By default, workers inherit 
the parameter settings of the master, but you can apply different parameter 
settings for different workers in the VMC file. You specify CPLEX 
parameters by name in the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;machine&gt;</samp> 
section for a worker in a VMC file.  In the event of a 
conflict between parameter settings for the master and parameter 
settings for a worker, the parameter settings in the VMC file take 
precedence.</p>

<p class="p">For example, the following line in a VMC file specifies that 
CPLEX performs depth-first search in both the ramp up phase and  
distributed MIP optimization. </p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>&lt;param name="CPX_PARAM_NODESEL" value="0"/&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting CPLEX parameters only for ramp up in a VMC file</h2>

<div class="p">CPLEX also offers a way of specifying parameters that apply only 
during ramp up for distributed parallel optimization. To specify that 
a given CPLEX parameter applies only during ramp up, prepend 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>rampup: </code></pre>

to the name of the CPLEX parameter in the virtual machine configuration (VMC) file.</div>

<p class="p">For example, look again at the line in a VMC file to specify that 
CPLEX performs depth-first search in both the ramp up phase and  
distributed MIP optimization. </p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>&lt;param name="CPX_PARAM_NODESEL" value="0"/&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="p">In contrast, the following line in a VMC file 
specifies that CPLEX performs depth-first search only in the ramp up 
phase; outside the ramp up phase, CPLEX applies the default setting 
for node selection during distributed MIP optimization.</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>&lt;param name="rampup:CPX_PARAM_NODESEL" value="0"/&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Special ramp up options in a VMC file</h2>

<p class="p">CPLEX recognizes special ramp up options in a virtual machine configuration (VMC) file 
so that you can give CPLEX useful information about the workers. </p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"unlikely_winner"</strong></p>


<p class="p">Some combinations of CPLEX parameter settings can have the effect 
of the worker having a very good dual bound, but very few unprocessed search tree nodes.
For example, forcing extremely strong cut generation 
in a worker can result in such a situation, making it unlikely for 
that worker to win the ramp up competition. In this case CPLEX is likely 
to delay switching from ramp up to distributed MIP, even though other workers 
may have already generated a good tree (though with a slightly worse dual bound). 
Therefore, you can mark this worker as unlikely to be a winner in a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p class="p">To indicate to CPLEX that you know that the CPLEX parameter settings can have this side-effect, 
use the following line in the section declaring the worker in the 
virtual machine configuration (VMC) file:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>&lt;param name="unlikely_winner" value="1"/&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="p">That line does <strong class="ph b">not</strong> exclude the worker from winning; it simply 
makes CPLEX take a harder look at the other workers when CPLEX considers 
when to terminate the ramp up phase. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"keeps_all_opt"</strong></p>

<p class="p">You can specify the ramp up option <samp class="ph codeph">"keeps_all_opt"</samp> in the 
<samp class="ph codeph">machine</samp> section for a worker in a virtual machine configuration (VMC) file 
to force CPLEX <strong class="ph b">not</strong> to eliminate any optimal solution during presolve in 
the ramp up phase. As a consequence of that ramp up option, CPLEX 
can merge information from that worker at the end of ramp up  before 
CPLEX starts the distributed MIP optimization.</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>&lt;param name="keeps_all_opt" value="1"/&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="p">When a worker is marked in that way, CPLEX makes sure that presolve does 
not eliminate any possible optimal solutions (rather than making sure that 
at least one optimal solution remains in the search space).</p>


<p class="p">Why does CPLEX offer this ramp up option?  Without this option, CPLEX 
can possibly eliminate some optimal solutions in a given worker. Furthermore, 
the combined set of optimal solutions eliminated from each of the workers can 
(unfortunately, by chance) cover every optimal solution to the problem.</p>

<p class="p">Therefore, CPLEX accepts information from those workers where this option is set and 
merges that acceptable information into the information from the worker that wins the 
ramp up competition. </p>

<p class="p">Whether to set this ramp up option for a worker or not is a delicately balanced decision. 
Setting this option enables CPLEX to merge information from the worker after ramp up. 
However, as a consequence of setting this option, presolve can be less effective in 
this worker. Not setting this option can make presolve more effective for this worker 
(a desirable outcome if this worker wins the ramp up competition). However, if the 
worker is not a winner, then some of the information that the worker gathered can 
<strong class="ph b">not</strong> be merged with the information from the winning worker.</p>

<p class="p">For example, consider the following straight forward problem: </p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>max x1 + x2
x1 + x2 ≤ 1
x1, x2 binary</code></pre>

<p class="p">In one worker, CPLEX can fix <samp class="ph codeph">x2=0</samp> (zero) as a result of presolve. 
After all, such a fix still retains the optimal solution <samp class="ph codeph">(x1=1, x2=0)</samp>.</p>

<p class="p">In another worker, again as a result of presolve, CPLEX can fix 
<samp class="ph codeph">x1=0</samp>. After all, that fix still keeps the optimal solution 
<samp class="ph codeph">(x1=0, x2=1)</samp>.</p>

<p class="p">If information from those two workers in this example were merged without 
consideration, then CPLEX concludes unfortunately in the distributed MIP optimization that 
<samp class="ph codeph">(x1=0, x2=0)</samp> and thus loses both optimal solutions found by those two workers 
(not the results you want, of course).</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Environment variables in a VMC file</h2>
<div class="p"> CPLEX expands an environment variable cited in a VMC file 
at the time that CPLEX reads the VMC file. Reference to an  
environment variable must be of the form: 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>$(name)</code></pre>

In particular, CPLEX does not recognize 
<samp class="ph codeph">$name</samp> 
nor <samp class="ph codeph">${name}</samp>. 
CPLEX interprets the character sequence 
<samp class="ph codeph">$$</samp> 
as a single <samp class="ph codeph">$</samp>. 
This convention means that you 
can produce verbatim <samp class="ph codeph">$(</samp> 
by writing <samp class="ph codeph">$$(</samp>. </div>
