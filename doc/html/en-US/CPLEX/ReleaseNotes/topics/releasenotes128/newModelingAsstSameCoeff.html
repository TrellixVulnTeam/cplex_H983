<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">These release notes highlight detection of same or nearly same coefficients, a new feature of modeling assistance 
in IBM CPLEX V12.8.0. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.8.0 offers a new feature in modeling assistance: detection of same or nearly same coefficients in a model.</p>
<p class="p">Experienced designers of mathematical programming models know that meaningful coefficients in 
a model must have values greater than CPLEX tolerances. Likewise, differences between coefficients of 
a given model must be greater than CPLEX tolerances.  For example, consider two coefficients in the same 
model that differ by a small amount, such as 1e-8. Assume further that you solve this model with 
the default value of the 
<a class="xref" href="../../../Parameters/topics/EpRHS.html" title="Specifies the feasibility tolerance, that is, the degree to which the basic variables of a model may violate their bounds.">feasibility tolerance</a> 
parameter as eprhs = 1e-6 and find that your model is feasible. Note, however, that if you change 
the feasibility tolerance to a stricter value, such as eprhs = 1e-9, the same model can become infeasible 
due to the two coefficients being so nearly the same value at that tolerance.</p>
<p class="p">Modeling assistance can detect situations like that, where coefficients of the same or 
very nearly the same value exist in your model and could give rise to numerical difficulties. 
 Indeed, these new messages in modeling assistance refer to such situations:</p>
