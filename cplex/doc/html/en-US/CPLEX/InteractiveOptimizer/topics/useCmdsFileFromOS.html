<title>Using Interactive Optimizer commands from your operating system</title>
</head>
<body id="UsingAFileOfInteractiveOptimizerCom"><div role="main">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Using Interactive Optimizer commands from
your operating system</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The Interactive Optimizer accepts a file or double-quoted commands from
your operating system.</p>
<div class="p">CPLEX recognizes commands for the Interactive Optimizer from your operating system. 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> 
cplex [-i] [-f <em class="ph i">commandfile</em> | -c "<em class="ph i">command1</em>" "<em class="ph i">command2</em>" . . . ]</code></pre>

In fact, CPLEX recognizes two approaches:
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">You can create a file of commands.</li>
<li class="li">You can double-quote Interactive commands on your operating system command line.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using a file of Interactive Optimizer commands</h2> 


<p class="p">You can create a file of Interactive Optimizer commands
to use from your operating system.  CPLEX accepts this file and executes
the commands in a session of the Interactive Optimizer. This strategy 
is available on operating systems, such as  Microsoft Windows,
GNU/Linux, or IBM z/OS. </p>
 
<p class="p">To use this feature of the Interactive Optimizer, first
create the file  as you normally create a new file on your operating
system. Put each Interactive Optimizer command on a separate line
in the file,  as you would type commands to enter in the Interactive
Optimizer. </p>

<p class="p"> To invoke your file of commands, use the following syntax
at the  command line of your operating system, where <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> is
the command  to invoke the Interactive Optimizer, <samp class="ph codeph">-f</samp> is
the option to specify a filename,  and <em class="ph i">filename</em> is the name
of your file:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex -f filename</code></pre>


<p class="p">If the name of the file containing commands includes spaces, be sure to 
enclose the name of the file in double quotation marks when you pass it to 
the <samp class="ph codeph">-f</samp> option. This technique of quoting file names that include 
spaces works for the command-line option; however, the <samp class="ph codeph">read</samp> command 
inside the Interactive Optimizer does not recognize file names including spaces, 
even when the file names are quoted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using double-quotation marks around Interactive Optimizer commands from the OS command line</h2>

<p class="p">In fact, if you enclose each of the Interactive Optimizer commands separately in double quotation marks, 
you are not obliged to collect them in a file. You can simply pass a series of commands 
(each enclosed in double quotation marks) 
to the Interactive Optimizer on the command line of your operating system, like this example:</p>
 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex -c "read <em class="ph i">a_problem_name.lp</em>" "optimize" "display solution variables -"</code></pre>

<p class="p">Or, with abbreviations, the same series of commands looks like this:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex -c "read <em class="ph i">a_problem_name.lp</em>" "opt" "disp sol var -"</code></pre>

<p class="p">In that example, <em class="ph i">a_problem_name</em> represents the name of a file containing a formatted 
model and data, <samp class="ph codeph">opt</samp> is the acceptable abbreviation of the command to optimize
the input, and <samp class="ph codeph">disp sol var - </samp> tells CPLEX to display the variables of the solution.</p>
 </div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Keeping a session active</h2> 
 
<p class="p">To tell CPLEX to keep an open session active (prompting you for commands) after it executes 
the commands listed on the command line (if you are using -c) or in a file of commands (if using -f), 
use the option <samp class="ph codeph">-i</samp> as the first option that you pass to the <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> 
command.  (If neither -c nor -f are present, CPLEX ignores the -i option.) For example:</p>
 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> 
cplex -i -f myfile</code></pre>
 
<p class="p">That sample command launches the CPLEX Interactive Optimizer, reads commands from the specified 
file, and keeps the session open with a prompt for further Interactive Optimizer commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Summary</h2> 

<div class="p">As you can see from that example, 
CPLEX recognizes a number of options with the <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> 
command from your operating-system 
command-line to manage a session of the Interactive Optimizer.
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">-i</strong> tells CPLEX to keep an open session of the Interactive Optimizer active.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">-f</strong> specifies that a filename for CPLEX to read follows.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">-c</strong> specifies that a command for the Interactive Optimizer follows.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">The order of those options is significant: you must launch a session (for example,
with the cplex command) before you issue a command in that session. </p>

<p class="p">To close a session and exit from the Interactive Optimizer, issue control-d on 
the operating-system command-line or from a file of commands.</p>
