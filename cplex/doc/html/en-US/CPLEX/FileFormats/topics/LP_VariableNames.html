<h1 class="title topictitle1">Variable names in LP file format</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX conforms to these rules about variable names in the LP file format.</p>
<p class="p">Variables can be named anything in LP format provided that the name does not exceed 255 characters,
all of which must be alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) or one of these
symbols: ! " # $ % &amp; ( ) , . ; ? @ _ ‘ ’ { } ~. Longer names are
truncated to 255 characters. A variable name can not begin with a
number or a period. </p>
<p class="p">The letter <samp class="ph codeph">E</samp> 
or <samp class="ph codeph">e</samp>, alone or followed by other valid
symbols, or followed by another <samp class="ph codeph">E</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">e</samp>, 
should be avoided as this notation is reserved
for exponential entries. Thus, variables can not be named <samp class="ph codeph">e9</samp>, 
<samp class="ph codeph">E-24</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">E8cats</samp>,
or other names that could be interpreted as an exponent. Even variable
names such as <samp class="ph codeph">eels</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">example</samp> 
can cause a read error, depending on their placement in an input line.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Good Practice</strong>: Variable names begin with a letter (other than E or e) 
or with an underscore.</p>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.LP_VariableNames__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.oplmultidimarrays"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Multi-dimensional arrays of variables from OPL</h2>
<p class="p">LP format does not support the square brackets [ and ] in variable names. 
This convention imposes special considerations about 
multi-dimensional arrays in OPL.</p>

<p class="p">When CPLEX translates your algebraic OPL model to the LP format, 
it must transform all multi-dimensional arrays of variables into scalar variables. 
This transformation assigns a different name to each element of each such array. 
In renaming the elements of arrays of variables, CPLEX does not simply concatenate
the indices of an element to approximate a new multi-digit index because 
simply concatenating the indices of elements as they are does not rename the elements unambiguously.
For example, consider a two-dimensional array named myarray with elements such as
myarray[1][23] and myarray[12][3].  Simple concatenation produces one ambiguous name, myarray[123],
for both of those distinct elements. Consequently, to avoid such ambiguity in renaming 
the elements of a multi-dimensional array of variables, the transformation to LP format 
introduces a separator (#). In this example, myarray[1][23] is renamed as myarray#1#23 and
myarray[12][3] is renamed as myarray#12#3.</p>

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.LP_VariableNames__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.LPnames"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conversion of names in LP files generated by CPLEX applications</h2>
<div class="p">A CPLEX application can create names of constraints and variables in a model, then export
that model as an LP file. In such a case, the CPLEX application programming interface (API) 
routines that create the names of variables are not restricted by the LP format syntax specified
in this topic.  Consequently, an LP file exported by a CPLEX application can contain 
names of constraints or variables that violate the syntax of the LP format.   
CPLEX tries to avoid this situation by automatically converting
names containing characters associated with arithmetic operations, 
such as  '+', '-', '*', ' '^',  and '['. CPLEX also automatically converts 
other characters that are ineligible for names (such as ":")  to names that adhere to 
the syntax of LP format.
CPLEX displays the following warning message when such a conversion occurs:
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> 
Warning:  Output names have been modified to conform to LP format.</code></pre>
