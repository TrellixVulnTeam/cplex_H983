<p class="p">The first line of the log indicates the type of problem, along
with the number of decision variables and constraints in the model.
In this case, there is an objective included in the model, so the
problem is reported to be a “Minimization problem”. When the model
does not include an objective, the problem type is reported as a “Satisfiability
problem”. The number of search phases, if any, is also displayed in
the first line. </p>
<p class="p">The second line of the log shows the result of presolve. The number
of model objects (extractables) eliminated is displayed along with
the number of constraints generated to improve the formulation of the 
eliminated extractables if any. </p>
<p class="p">Any parameter change from its default is displayed after the preprocessing
information.</p>
<p class="p">The next three lines of the log provide information regarding the
initial constraint propagation. The “Initial process time” is the
time in seconds spent at the root node of the search tree where the
initial propagation occurs. This time encompasses the time used by
the optimizer to load the model, called extraction, and the time spent
in initial propagation. The value for “Log search space” provides
an estimate on the size of the depth-first search tree; this value
is the log (base 2) of the products of the domains sizes of all the
decision variables of the problem. Typically, the estimate of the
size of the search tree should be smaller after the initial propagation,
as choices will have been eliminated. However, this value is always
an overestimate of the log of the number of remaining leaf nodes of
the tree because it does not take into account the action of propagation
of constraints at each node. The memory used by the optimizer during
the initial propagation is reported. </p>
<p class="p">The log then display the type of search used, sequential or parallel;
in the latter case, the number of workers used is also displayed. </p>
<p class="p">In order to interpret the remainder of the log file, you may want
to think about the search as a binary tree. The root of the tree is
the starting point in the search for a solution; each branch descending
from the root represents an alternative choice or decision in the
search. Each of these branches leads to a node where constraint propagation
during search will occur. If the branch does not lead to a failure
and a solution is not found at a node, the node is called a choice
point. The optimizer can make an additional decision and create two
new alternative branches from the current node, or it can jump in
the tree and search from another node.</p>
<p class="p">The lines in the next section of the progress log are displayed
periodically during the search and describe the state of the search.
The display frequency of the progress log can be controlled with parameters
of the optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">The progress information given in a progress log update includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Best: the value of the best solution found so far, in the case
of an optimization problem;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Branches: the number of branches explored in the binary search
tree;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Non-fixed: the number of uninstantiated (not fixed) model variables,
or the elapsed time;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">W: the id of the worker at the branch currently under consideration
by the optimizer;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Branch decision: the decision made at the branch currently
under consideration by the optimizer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For optimization problems, whenever a solution is found, the log displays a specific line starting with "*". 
In this line, the time is displayed in place of the non-fixed value (which
is always zero in this case), and the relative gap is displayed when it is meaningful in place of the branch decision.
For minimization (resp. maximization) problems, the best known lower (resp. upper) bound is displayed each time it is
improved, in a line starting with "+".</p>
<p class="p">The final lines of the log provide information about the entire
search, after the search has terminated. This information about the search includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> Termination status line: the conditions under which the search
terminated and the number of solutions found during search;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Best objective: the value of the best solution found during
search along with the effective optimality tolerance;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Best bound: in case of optimality, this is equal to the best objective;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Number of branches: the number of branches explored in the
binary search tree;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Number of fails: the number of branches that did not lead to
a solution;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Total memory usage: the memory used by IBM® ILOG® Concert
Technology and the CP Optimizer engine;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Time spent in solve: the elapsed time from start to the end
of the search displayed in hh:mm:ss.ff format;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Search speed: average time spent per branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If the search terminated due to a limit, this final part of the log could be quite different and the objective not optimal, as in the following sample:</p>

<p class="p">In the progress update, you can see that the column "Best" gives only the value of the first criteria of the best solution found so far.
The values of all the criteria of the best solution found are displayed when a new solution is found. Likewise, The values of all the criteria of the best bound found are displayed when a new bound is found.</p>
<p class="p">Finally, notice that the gap is computed on the first (i.e., most important in lexicographic optimization) non optimal criterion. The log displays the gap and the rank of of the criterion on which it is computed. For instance, if the first two criteria are within the optimality tolerance, then the gap on the third criterion is displayed as follows:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   ( gap is 25.50% @ crit. 3 of 4)</code></pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p">   The CP Optimizer search log is meant for visual inspection
only, not for mechanized parsing. In particular, the log may change
from version to version of CP Optimizer in order to improve the quality
of information displayed in the log. Any code based on the log output
may have to be updated when a new version of CP Optimizer is released.
