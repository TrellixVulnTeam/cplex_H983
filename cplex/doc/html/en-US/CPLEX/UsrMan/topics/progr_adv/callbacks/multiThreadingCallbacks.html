<body id="multiThreadingCallback"><div role="main">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Multithreading and generic callbacks </h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Generic callbacks demand certain considerations when used in a multithreaded application. </p>
<p class="p"> 
There are conventions to observe when you use a generic callback in a multithreaded application of CPLEX.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Global and thread-local information</h2> 
 
<p class="p"> In general, any information that can be queried in a generic callback is <strong class="ph b">thread-local</strong>. 
That is, the values returned for queries are based on the information that the current 
thread can see at the moment the callback is invoked. This return is not necessarily 
all information available to CPLEX.</p>

<p class="p">Consider, for example, a multithreaded search of a tree in a minimization problem. 
Let T denote the set of all open nodes. 
Assume that the tree is searched with two threads, and T is partitioned into three sets: T1, T2, and TX. 
Let the nodes in T1 be assigned to the first thread, and those in T2 to the second thread. 
Nodes in TX are not assigned to any thread. In this setting, best objective bound in the first thread 
is the minimum of the LP relaxations of all nodes in T1. This bound may well be larger than 
the global objective bound, which is the minimum of the LP relaxations of all nodes in T1, T2, and TX. 
Moreover, the objective bound in the first thread can decrease if a node that 
is currently in TX moves to T1. Similar considerations apply to the best known objective value. </p>

<p class="p">The only situation in which callback queries return globally valid data is 
when the context of the generic callback is 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_GLOBAL_PROGRESS.html" title="Generic callback at global progress">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_GLOBAL_PROGRESS</a>. 
 This context is also the only case in which CPLEX guarantees a deterministic order of callback invocations. 
 For all other callback contexts, the order of callback invocations between 
 different threads is not deterministic. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Speculative execution of code</h2> 
 
<p class="p">In general, you cannot assume that information that you pass to CPLEX 
from within a generic callback will be used and recorded by CPLEX. </p>

<p class="p">In multithreaded execution, CPLEX may perform speculative execution of some algorithms. 
A common case is that CPLEX launches search tasks that are parallel to the main solution algorithm. 
These tasks might be interrupted before their completion or even possibly ignored. This situation 
means that anything (such as a heuristic, a lazy constraint, and so forth) that was passed by the 
user within these tasks through the generic callback might be discarded and might not be applied as
the user expects. </p>
 
<p class="p">Likewise, any information found by CPLEX itself (and reported to the user) in such tasks 
might have to be discarded. Consequently, you can not assume that any thread-local information 
reported from a generic callback will definitely make it into a globally valid state. 
Only global information is definitive. </p>
 
<p class="p">In contrast, CPLEX does not invoke a generic callback in the context 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_GLOBAL_PROGRESS.html" title="Generic callback at global progress">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_GLOBAL_PROGRESS</a> 
when CPLEX is engaged in speculative evaluation. Thus, everything submitted in such an invocation 
can be used by CPLEX. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Thread safety and generic callbacks</h2> 

<p class="p">CPLEX itself cannot guarantee the thread-safety of a generic callback in an application. In other words, thread-safety 
in a multithreaded application is ultimately the responsibility of the user.  You must 
protect access to global data, for example, by appropriate locks. However, if CPLEX routines accept 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/typedefs/CPXCALLBACKCONTEXTptr.html" title="Pointer to a callback context.">CPXCALLBACKCONTEXTptr</a> as an argument, 
then you can safely call those routines from generic callbacks in different threads.</p>
 
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> There is an important exception to that general rule: invocations of a generic callback 
in the context 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_GLOBAL_PROGRESS.html" title="Generic callback at global progress">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_GLOBAL_PROGRESS</a> 
holds a lock. Such invocations are consequently thread-safe.  However, lengthy computations in the  
callback blocks other threads. In other words, your application should not perform lengthy computations 
in such situations because you risk blocking other threads. </div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Thread notifications</h2> 
 
<p class="p">It may be important to your application to know when CPLEX starts or ends a new thread. 
In other words, you want CPLEX to notify your application when CPLEX starts or ends a new thread.
In such a case, have CPLEX invoke the callback with the context 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_UP.html" title="Generic callback at thread start">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_UP</a> 
when it starts the thread.
Likewise, have CPLEX invoke the callback with the context 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_DOWN.html" title="Generic callback at thread end">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_DOWN</a> 
when it ends the thread. These contexts carry out "book-keeping" tasks. For example, 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_UP.html" title="Generic callback at thread start">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_UP</a> 
can potentially create thread-local data, while 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_DOWN.html" title="Generic callback at thread end">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_DOWN</a> 
can potentially destroy thread-local data. </p>
 
<p class="p"> 
These contexts typically have no information 
about the current state or progress of the search.  Attempts to query such information from these
contexts returns an error.</p>
 
<p class="p">Furthermore, <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_DOWN.html" title="Generic callback at thread end">CPX_CALLBACKCONTEXT_THREAD_DOWN</a> 
ignores the return value of the callback function. </p>
