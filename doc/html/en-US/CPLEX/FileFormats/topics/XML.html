<h1 class="title topictitle1">XML file format: serialized models and solutions</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX offers
an XML file format to support serialized models and solutions.</p>
<p class="p">Concert Technology for C++ users offers a suite of classes
for serializing CPLEX models
(that is, instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> ) and solutions
(that is, instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IloSolution</samp>) through
XML. The <em class="ph i">CPLEX C++ API Reference Manual</em> documents
the XML serialization API in the group <samp class="ph codeph">optim.concert.xml</samp>.
That group includes these classes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloXmlContext</samp> allows
you to serialize an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">IloSolution</samp>.
This class offers methods for reading and writing a model, a solution,
or both a model and a solution together. There are examples of how
to use this class in the reference manual.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloXmlInfo</samp> offers
methods that enable you to validate the XML serialization of elements,
such as numeric arrays, integer arrays, variables, and other extractables
from your model or solution. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloXmlReader</samp> creates
a reader in an environment (that is, in an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloEnv</samp>).
This class offers methods to check runtime type information (RTTI),
to recognize hierarchic relations between objects, and to access attributes
of objects in your model or solution.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloXmlWriter</samp> creates
a writer in an environment (that is, in an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloEnv</samp>).
This class offers methods to access elements and to convert their
types as needed in order to serialize elements of your model or solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tip</strong>: If your XML model includes piecewise linear constraints (PWL), 
you must specify breakpoints in a PWL constraint in increasing order of 
the x-coordinates of the breakpoints. 
Otherwise, CPLEX cannot extract them as you intend. </p>
<div class="p">As a demonstration of the effect of order among breakpoints, consider, for example, these breakpoints: 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> 
(0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1)
(0,0) (1,1) (1,0) (2,1) </code></pre>
 
Both sets cite the same four breakpoints, but notice that the order is different.
The first set specifies these two horizontal line segments:
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> 
                          _
(0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1)  _</code></pre>
 
The second set specifies these two parallel line segments sloping at 45 degrees: 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> 
(0,0) (1,1) (1,0) (2,1) //</code></pre>
 </div>
<p class="p">For a definition of a piecewise-linear (PWL) constraint, see the topic 
<a class="xref" href="../../UsrMan/topics/discr_optim/pwl/02_pwl_defn.html" title="Defines a piecewise linear function.">What is a piecewise linear function?</a> 
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's Manual</em>. 
For an example of a C++ application using piecewise-linear constraints, see 
<samp class="ph codeph">ilotransport.cpp</samp>, described in detail in 
<a class="xref" href="../../UsrMan/topics/discr_optim/pwl/01_pwl_title_synopsis.html" title="Demonstrates the use of piecewise linear functions to solve a transportation problem.">Using piecewise linear functions in optimization: a transport example</a>, 
 in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's Manual</em>.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">There is a fundamental difference between writing an
XML file of a model and writing an LP/MPS/SAV file of the same extracted
model. Some higher level modeling constructs do not have an equivalent 
representation in the solver engine and have to be transformed when passed 
to the solver engine. The XML file will represent those constructs as such.
In contrast, the LP/MPS/SAV file will represent only the transformed
model. That transformed model obscures those features because
of the automatic transformation that took place.  </p>
