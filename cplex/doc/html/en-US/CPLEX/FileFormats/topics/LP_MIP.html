<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX conforms to these rules about MIP features in the LP file format.</p>
<p class="p">LP file format supports special features of mixed integer programming (MIP), 
such as binary variables, integer variables, semi-continuous variables, 
special ordered sets (SOS), and branching priorities. See also 
<a class="xref" href="LP_PWL.html" title="CPLEX conforms to these rules about piecewise linear (PWL) constraints in LP file format.">Piecewise linear (PWL) constraints in LP file format</a>

<p class="p">This rule applies to the CPLEX MIP optimizer. </p>
 
<p class="p">To specify any of the variables as general integer variables, 
add a <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp> section; to specify any of the variables
as binary integer variables, add a <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp> 
section. The <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp> 
sections follow the <samp class="ph codeph">BOUNDS</samp>  section, if
one is present; otherwise, they follow the constraints section. Either
of the <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp> 
sections can precede the other. The <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp> 
section is preceded by the word <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp>, 
<samp class="ph codeph">GENERALS</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">GEN</samp>  in 
any mix of upper- and lowercase characters which must appear alone
on a line. The following line or lines should list the names of all
variables which are to be restricted to general integer values, separated
by at least one space. The <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp>  section
is preceded by the word <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">BINARIES</samp>, 
or <samp class="ph codeph">BIN</samp>  in
any mix of upper- and lowercase characters which must appear alone
on a line. The following line or lines should list the names of all
variables which are to be restricted to binary integer values, separated
by at least one space. Binary variables are automatically given bounds
of 0 (zero) and 1 (one), unless alternative bounds are specified in
the <samp class="ph codeph">BOUNDS</samp>  section, in which case a warning
message is issued.</p>
 
<p class="p">Here is an example of a problem
formulation in LP format where <samp class="ph codeph">x4</samp>  is a
general integer:  </p>
 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Maximize
 obj: x1 + 2 x2 + 3 x3 + x4
Subject To
 c1: - x1 + x2 + x3 + 10 x4 &lt;= 20
 c2: x1 - 3 x2 + x3 &lt;= 30
 c3: x2 - 3.5 x4 = 0
Bounds
 0 &lt;= x1 &lt;= 40
 2 &lt;= x4 &lt;= 3
General
 x4
End</code></pre>
<p class="p">If branching priorities or branching directions
exist, enter this information through ORD files, as documented 
in <a class="xref" href="ORD.html" title="The ORD file format supports priorities and branching orders.">ORD file format: priorities and branching orders</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.LP_MIP__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177272"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP semi-continuous variables</h2> 
 
 
 
<p class="p">This rule applies to the
CPLEX MIP optimizer. </p>
<p class="p">To specify any of the variables
as semi-continuous variables, that is as variables that may take the
value <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp>  or values between the specified
lower and upper bounds, use a <samp class="ph codeph">SEMI-CONTINUOUS</samp> 
section. This section must follow the <samp class="ph codeph">BOUNDS</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">GENERALS</samp> , and <samp class="ph codeph">BINARIES</samp> 
sections. The <samp class="ph codeph">SEMI-CONTINUOUS</samp>  section is
preceded by the keyword <samp class="ph codeph">SEMI-CONTINUOUS</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">SEMI</samp> , or <samp class="ph codeph">SEMIS</samp> . The
following line or lines should list the names of all the variables
which are to be declared semi-continuous, separated by at least one
space.</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">Semi-continuous</samp> </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">x1 x2 x3</samp> </p>

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.LP_MIP__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177280"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP special ordered sets</h2> 
 
 
<p class="p">This rule applies to the CPLEX MIP optimizer. To specify
special ordered sets, use an SOS section, which is preceded by the
SOS keyword. The SOS section should follow the Bounds, General, Binaries
and Semi-Continuous sections. Special ordered sets of type 1 require
that, of the variables in the set, one at most may be nonzero. Special
ordered sets of type 2 require that at most two variables in the set
may be nonzero, and if there are two nonzeros, they must be adjacent.
Adjacency is defined by the weights, which must be unique within a
set given to the variables. The sorted weights define the order of
the special ordered set. For MIP branch and cut, the order is used
to decide how the variables are branched upon. See the <em class="ph i">CPLEX
User’s Manual</em> for more information. The set is specified by an
optional set name followed by a colon and then either of the S1 or
S2 keywords (specifying the type) followed by a double colon. The
set member names are listed on this line or lines, with their weights.
Variable names and weights are separated by a colon, for example:</p>
 
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">SOS</samp> </p>
 
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">  set1: S1::  x1:10  x2:13</samp> </p>
 </div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.LP_MIP__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177287"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP indicator constraints</h2> 
 
 
 
<p class="p">This rule applies to CPLEX MIP optimizer.</p>
 
<p class="p">To specify an indicator constraint,
enter it among any other constraints in the model, like this:  </p>
 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>[constraintname:]  binaryvariable = value  -&gt;  linear constraint</code></pre>
 
<p class="p">The constraint name, followed by a colon,
is optional. The hyphen followed by the greater-than symbol (<samp class="ph codeph">-&gt;</samp>), 
separates the indicator variable and its
value from the linear constraint that is controlled. The indicator
variable must be declared as a binary variable, and the value it is
compared to must be either 0 (zero) or 1 (one).</p>
 

<p class="p">These <strong class="ph b">limitations</strong> apply to indicator constraints in LP file format:</p>
 
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The constraint must be linear; a quadratic constraint is not allowed to have an indicator constraint.</li>
<li class="li">A lazy constraint cannot have an indicator constraint.</li>
<li class="li">A user-defined cut cannot have an indicator constraint.</li>
</ul>
