<p class="p">This means that, 
although only one model exists, each worker has its own engine objects to work with during 
the search process. 
Indeed, each worker is associated with a backtracking search engine, represented by an 
instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCPEngine</samp>. An <samp class="ph codeph">IloCPEngine</samp> is in charge of performing the search for this 
worker. It is given all the engine objects that have been extracted for the worker, and
it provides the mapping from model variables to engine variables, which is needed to write 
custom constraints and goals.</p>
