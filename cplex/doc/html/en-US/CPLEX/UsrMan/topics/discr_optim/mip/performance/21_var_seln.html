<h1 class="title topictitle1">Selecting variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes trade-offs around variable selection and options of the parameter to control selection
of the next variable.</p>
<p class="p">After a node has been selected, the variable selection
parameter influences which variable is chosen for branching at that
node. (For documentation of that parameter, see <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/VarSel.html" title="Sets the rule for selecting the branching variable at the node which has been selected for branching.">MIP variable selection strategy</a> in
the <em class="ph i">CPLEX Parameters Reference Manual</em>.)</p>
<p class="p">When CPLEX selects a branching variable during execution of the branch and cut algorithm, 
there is a trade-off between more informed selections that require more computational effort 
and less informed selections that are computationally cheaper. More computationally intensive 
selection procedures can reduce the node count, but also reduce the rate of node throughput. 
Less intensive procedures can increase the node count, but that improved node throughput can 
yield an improvement in overall performance. If you can properly assess these trade-offs for 
your model, you can achieve faster performance than the default variable selection strategy in 
CPLEX. </p>
<p class="p">The key here is the concept of <strong class="ph b">strong branching</strong>, which can be computationally 
expensive, but which can yield valuable information about branching. The idea behind 
strong branching at a node relaxation (root node or child node) is the selection of a 
subset of the integer-restricted variables with fractional values in the node relaxation 
solution. For each variable in this subset, CPLEX explores both the up and down branches 
by running a modest number of simplex iterations; CPLEX then uses the results to assess 
the benefit of branching up or down on that variable. </p>
<p class="p"> 
Setting the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/VarSel.html" title="Sets the rule for selecting the branching variable at the node which has been selected for branching.">MIP variable selection strategy</a> parameter 
to 3 does this at every node.</p>
<p class="p"> 
The default of the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/VarSel.html" title="Sets the rule for selecting the branching variable at the node which has been selected for branching.">MIP variable selection strategy</a> parameter 
(which is typically 2) computes strong branching data at the root node in order to calculate 
<strong class="ph b">pseudo costs</strong> for each variable. These pseudo costs really help with subsequent branching, 
but their calculation can be expensive. Setting the parameter to 4 computes much less expensive 
pseudo <strong class="ph b">reduced</strong> costs. This choice can save time, particularly at the root node when you have 
asked CPLEX to perform an optimization with limited total run time.</p>
<p class="p"> 
Recent versions of CPLEX perform powerful computations when processing the root node, and 
consequently many models solve to optimality (or close to optimality) at the root node. 
If most of the time is spent at the root node, CPLEX has little time left then for branching, 
so the benefit  of more informed branching decisions at the child node probably may not be 
worth the cost of those root node calculations. </p>
<p class="p"> 
Note that this situation will not always be the case, though.</p>
<p class="p"> 
Sometimes, strong branching calculations at the root yield variable fixings. For example, 
if CPLEX quickly discovers that the up branch on a binary variable is infeasible, CPLEX 
can immediately fix that variable to 0 (zero). These variable fixings yielded by strong 
branching calculations can make heuristics more effective, or can yield other 
performance improvements.  </p>
<p class="p"> 
So, do not always set the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/VarSel.html" title="Sets the rule for selecting the branching variable at the node which has been selected for branching.">MIP variable selection strategy</a> parameter 
to 4 with models that run for only a few nodes. But, for models where CPLEX seems to 
spend a lot time at the root node, consider setting the parameter to 4 to see whether that helps.</p>
<p class="p"> 
Similarly, for models where root node processing time is brief, node relaxations solve quickly, 
and lack of progress toward the best node is an issue, consider the more computationally 
expensive setting of 3 for the 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/VarSel.html" title="Sets the rule for selecting the branching variable at the node which has been selected for branching.">MIP variable selection strategy</a> parameter. 
This setting instructs CPLEX to perform strong branching calculations at the child nodes 
as well as at the root node.</p>
