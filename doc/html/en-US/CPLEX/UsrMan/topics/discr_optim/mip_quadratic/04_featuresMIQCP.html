<h1 class="title topictitle1">Features of the MIP optimizer for MIQCP</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Specifies features of the MIP optimizer that are relevant to 
mixed integer quadratically constrained programs (MIQCP).</p>
<p class="p">Solving a mixed integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) can introduce 
special considerations with respect to the branch and bound search. Some MIQCP models
lend themselves to solution as a second order cone program. In other MIQCP models, 
outer approximation can be a useful strategy. Special considerations about cuts can also 
apply to some MIQCP models.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SOCP branch and bound or outer approximation?</h2>
<p class="p">CPLEX solves most MIQCP models roughly in the same way as it solves other mixed integer 
programs (MIP). However, CPLEX offers algorithmic options adapted to the nonlinearity of the 
quadratic constraints in a MIQCP model. Indeed, CPLEX offers two main search strategies to 
solve a MIQCP model.</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li">One strategy exploits a branch and bound search tree based on the continuous QCP solver. 
For more information about the QCP solver, see 
<a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/qcp/01_QCP_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the solution of quadratically constrained programming problems (QCPs), including the special case of second order cone programming problems (SOCPs).">Solving problems with quadratic constraints (QCP)</a>.</li>
<li class="li">Another strategy exploits outer approximation relying on the continuous LP solver to 
build a search tree.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p">To choose between these two strategies, the user sets the 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/MIQCPStrat.html" title="Sets the strategy that CPLEX uses to solve a quadratically constrained mixed integer program (MIQCP).">MIQCP strategy switch</a>, as 
documented in the reference manual <em class="ph i">Parameters of CPLEX</em>.</p>

<p class="p">In the branch and bound strategy based on the QCP solver, CPLEX develops a search tree 
and solves the continuous relaxation of the model by the SOCP solver at each node of the tree. 
That is, at each node of the tree, all quadratic constraints are satisfied.</p>

<p class="p">In the outer approximation strategy, CPLEX builds a linear approximation of the model by 
using first order approximations of the quadratic constraints. These linear approximations are 
refined throughout the algorithm to yield an optimal solution that satisfies all the quadratic 
constraints of the model. The linear approximation cuts are known as <em class="ph i">cone linearizations</em>.</p>

<p class="p">By default, CPLEX tries to choose the best of the two strategies. However, you may have 
knowledge of your model that implies that one of the two strategies is more appropriate. In that 
case, you can choose the strategy manually to yield better results. </p>

<p class="p">Usually, the branch and bound 
strategy based on the QCP solver has the advantage of obtaining tighter bounds at the nodes; these 
tighter bounds at the nodes can cost much more time to process each node. </p>

<p class="p">In contrast, the outer approximation strategy based on the LP solver has the advantage of 
processing nodes faster, but the relaxations in this strategy can be weaker.</p>

<p class="p">On some numerically challenging models, one strategy can be more robust than the other.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cuts and MIQCP</h2>
<p class="p">All the cuts available in CPLEX to solve a mixed integer program (MIP) are also available to 
solve a MIQCP.  For more about MIP cuts, see 
<a class="xref" href="../mip/cuts/26_cuts_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes types of cuts available in the MIP optimizer as performance features.">Cuts</a> in this manual.</p>

<p class="p">Cone cuts are separated automatically, depending on the strategy used to solve MIQCPs.</p>
