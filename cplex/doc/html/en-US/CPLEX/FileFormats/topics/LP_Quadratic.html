<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX conforms to these rules about quadratic terms in LP file format.</p>
<p class="p">This rule applies to applications that solve problems with
quadratic terms in them, that is, quadratic programming problems and
quadratically constrained programs (QPs and QCPs). Quadratic coefficients
can appear in the objective function. Quadratic coefficients can also
appear in constraints under certain conditions. If there are quadratically
constrained variables in the problem, see also rules about 
<a class="xref" href="LP_VariableNames.html" title="CPLEX conforms to these rules about variable names in the LP file format.">Variable names in LP file format</a> and 
<a class="xref" href="LP_Constraints.html" title="CPLEX conforms to these rules for the LP file format.">Constraints in LP file format</a> in this manual, as well as 
 <a class="xref" href="../../UsrMan/topics/cont_optim/qcp/01_QCP_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the solution of quadratically constrained programming problems (QCPs), including the special case of second order cone programming problems (SOCPs).">Solving problems with quadratic constraints (QCP)</a> 
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User’s Manual</em>.</p>
<p class="p">The algebraic coefficients of the
function x'Qx are specified inside square brackets<samp class="ph codeph"> []</samp> .
The square brackets must be followed by a divide sign followed by
the number 2. This convention denotes that all coefficients inside
the square brackets will be divided by 2 in evaluating the quadratic
terms of the objective function. All quadratic coefficients must appear
inside square brackets. Multiple square bracket sections may be specified.</p>
<p class="p">Inside of the square brackets, two variables are multiplied
by an asterisk (<samp class="ph codeph">*</samp>). For example, <samp class="ph codeph">[4x*y]</samp> indicates that the coefficients of both of
the off-diagonal terms of Q, corresponding to the variables <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp>  in the model
are 2, since <samp class="ph codeph">4x*y</samp>  equals <samp class="ph codeph">2x*y + 2x*y</samp>.
Each pair of off-diagonal terms of Q is specified only once. CPLEX
automatically creates both off-diagonal entries of Q. Diagonal terms
in Q (that is, terms with an exponent of 2) are indicated by the caret
(<samp class="ph codeph">^</samp> ) followed by 2. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">4x^2</samp> indicates that the coefficient of the diagonal
term of Q corresponding to the variable <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> in
the model is 4.</p>
<p class="p">For example, this problem</p>
<p class="p">Minimize
a + b + 1/2(a<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> + 4ab +7b<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>)</p>
<p class="p">subject to a + b ≥ 10 and a, b ≥ 0</p>
<p class="p">in LP format looks like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Minimize
obj: a + b + [ a^2 + 4 a * b + 7 b^2 ]/2
Subject To
c1: a + b &gt;= 10
End</code></pre>
