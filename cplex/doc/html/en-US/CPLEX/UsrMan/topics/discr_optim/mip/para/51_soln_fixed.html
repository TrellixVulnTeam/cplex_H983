<p class="p">Integer variables often represent major structural decisions in
a model, and many continuous variables of the model can be related
to these major decisions. With that observation in mind, if you take
the integer variable solution values as given, then you can obtain
useful post-solution information that applies only to the continuous
variables, in the usual way. This observation about the information
available only for continuous variables in a MIP is the idea behind
the so-called "<strong class="ph b">fixed MIP</strong>" problem. The fixed MIP is a form
of the MIP problem where as many as possible of the discrete variables 
are fixed at values corresponding to a MIP solution; that is, the discrete
variables are fixed in the sense of "set at a given value." Thus a fixed
MIP is a continuous problem that is not strictly a relaxation of the
MIP, but rather a restriction to its continuous part.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What does CPLEX fix?</h2> 
 
<p class="p">CPLEX typically constructs a fixed MIP problem from the current 
model and a solution. To do so, CPLEX sets as many variables as 
possible to the value of that variable in that solution such that 
the resulting remaining model is continuous.  In particular, that 
convention means the following fixes occur:</p>
 
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">CPLEX fixes all Boolean variables at their solution value and relaxes the variable to continuous.</li>
<li class="li">CPLEX fixes all integer variables at their solution value and relaxes the variable to continuous.</li>
<li class="li">CPLEX fixes all semi-integer variables at their solution value and relaxes the variable to continuous.</li>
<li class="li">If a semi-continuous variable has a solution value of 0 (zero), then CPLEX fixes 
the semi-continuous variable to that value; otherwise, the semi-continuous variable is relaxed to continuous 
with the semi-continuous lower bound as the lower bound of the relaxed continuous variable.</li>
<li class="li">In a special ordered set of type 1 (SOS1) consisting of N members, CPLEX fixes N-1 of the variables in 
 the SOS1 to the solution value. Only the variable with the value most different from 
 0 (zero) remains unfixed.  CPLEX discards the SOS1. </li>
<li class="li">In a special ordered set of type 2 (SOS2) consisting of N members, CPLEX fixes N-2 of the variables 
 to the solution value.  Only two consecutive variables with values most different from 
 0 (zero) are left unfixed. CPLEX discards the SOS2. 
 </li>
<li class="li">If the lefthand side (lhs) of an indicator constraint is satisfied by the solution, CPLEX installs the 
 righthand side (rhs) as a constraint. In any case, CPLEX discards the indicator constraints.
 </li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accessing dual information in a fixed MIP problem</h2> 
 
<p class="p">If you wish to access dual information in such a problem, first
optimize your MILP problem to create the fixed MILP problem; then
re-optimize it, like this:</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In <strong class="ph b">Concert Technology</strong>, call the method <samp class="ph codeph">solveFixed</samp> .
(There is no explicit problem type in Concert Technology, so there
is no need to change the problem type as in other components.)</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Callable Library (C API)</strong>, call the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXchgprobtype</samp> 
with the argument <samp class="ph codeph">CPXPROB_FIXEDMILP</samp>  as the problem
type and then call <samp class="ph codeph">CPXlpopt</samp> .</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong>, use these commands to
change the problem type and re-optimize:</p>
 
    <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">change problem fixed_milp</samp> </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">optimize</samp> </p>
</li>
</ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<p class="p">As explained in <a class="xref" href="49_mipStarts.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1219740389375">Managing a MIP start with the advanced start switch</a>,
setting 2 of the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/AdvInd.html" title="If set to 1 or 2, this parameter specifies that CPLEX should use advanced starting information when it initiates optimization.">advanced start switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp> in
Concert Technology; <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_ADVIND</samp> in the Callable
Library) can be particularly useful for solving fixed MIP models,
where a start vector but no corresponding basis is available. </p>
