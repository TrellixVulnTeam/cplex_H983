<h1 class="title topictitle1">Special considerations about indices and names in modeling assistance in CPLEX</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX can assist you as you develop your model.</p>
<p class="p">Some models include explicit names of variables and constraints. Other models do not. A model 
read from a file in SAV format, for example, can lack such names.</p>
<p class="p">If your model lacks names of variables or names of constraints, the warnings  
from modeling assistance refer to those variables or constraints by <strong class="ph b">index</strong>. In CPLEX modeling 
assistance, by convention, indices begin with 0 (zero). </p>
<p class="p">Recall that whether indices begin numbering at 0 (zero) or at 1 (one) 
can vary according to conventions of a programming language or other interface. For example, 
the Interactive Optimizer numbers indices from 1 (one), whereas the Callable Library (C API),  
following C programming conventions, numbers indices from 0 (zero). </p>
<p class="p">Consequently, when you receive warnings referring to constraints or variables by index, you 
need to convert the indices if there is such an incongruence between CPLEX modeling assistance 
(where indexing starts at 0 (zero)) and your interface (if indexing starts at 1 (one)). </p>
<p class="p">For example, suppose you are using the Interactive Optimizer (where indexing starts at 1 (one)) 
to read a SAV file with no names of constraints or variables. Suppose also that you have turned on 
modeling assistance. If CPLEX modeling assistance issues a warning about a constraint or variable 
in your model, the warning will refer to that constraint or variable by index. Keep in mind that 
in modeling assistance, numbering of indices starts at 0 (zero).  Consequently, in this example, 
you need to add one to the index reported in the modeling assistance warning in order to identify 
the constraint or variable in terms of the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
